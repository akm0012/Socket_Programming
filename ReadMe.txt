Overview:These two programs show how I used both TCP and UDP socket programming to allow two Clients to play the classic game of NIM with one another.  The Server is used to arrange a “rendezvous” between the two Clients, and then after the two Clients are paired, they only interact with one another.  For instructions on how to play NIM visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim. Compile Instructions:The easiest way to compile all files is to run "compile_all.cmd" by typing: 	./compile_all.cmd  Note: if you do not have run permissions, you may have to type: 	chmod 775 compile_all.cmdIf you want to compile the programs individually, you can do so by typing the following:	cc -o Client.exe Client.c	cc -o Server.exe Server.cRun Instructions: To run the server type:	./Server.exe [PORT NUMBER]	[PORT NUMBER]: The port on which the server is accepting requests.To run a client type:	./Client.exe  [SERVER NAME] [PORT NUMBER] [MY PORT][SERVER NAME]: The server hostname.[PORT NUMBER]: The port where the server is running.[MY PORT]: The TCP port where the client is willing to play NIM.Example:	./Server 10025	./Client.exe 127.0.0.1 10025 10085 Note: You will have to run 2 clients in order to play a game of NIM.  Otherwise, 1 client will just be waiting forever to be paired up with another client.
